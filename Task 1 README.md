#  Task 01: Population Distribution Analysis

##  Objective
The goal of this task is to analyze population distribution data across various regions and uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies. By visualizing and understanding how populations vary geographically, we can identify regions of high density, potential resource pressure zones, and aid better decision-making in urban planning, resource allocation, and policy formulation.

##  Key Insights
- Regions **X** and **Y** have the highest population densities.
- Found a **significant urban-rural gap** in several states.
- A few missing values in population fields were handled using interpolation.
- Visualizations reveal a **skewed distribution** in certain areas indicating overpopulation pressure.

---

##  Results
- Plotted heatmaps and bar charts to highlight disparities.
- Created correlation plots to understand relationships with other variables (e.g., urbanization rate).
- Produced a clean, interpretable dataset ready for dashboarding or model integration.

---

##  Conclusion
This analysis sets the foundation for more advanced demographic studies and policy forecasting. The cleaned dataset and visuals help pinpoint regions where immediate planning and intervention are necessary.

---

##  Future Work
- Integrate socio-economic factors like literacy, employment, and health metrics.
- Expand analysis to include temporal population shifts.
- Create interactive dashboards using Power BI or Tableau.
